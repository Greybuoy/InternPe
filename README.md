Rock Paper Scissors Game(Rps)
It is a  text-based Rock Paper Scissors game written in Java. In this game, you play against the computer by choosing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The computer also randomly selects one of these options. The winner of each round is determined based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game continues until you choose to quit.

How to Play
Run the program in a Java environment.

You will be prompted to enter your choice: rock, paper, or scissors. You can also type "quit" to exit the game.

The computer will randomly select its choice.

The winner of the round will be displayed.

You can play multiple rounds or quit at any time by typing "quit."

Code Explanation
The code uses a loop to keep the game running until you decide to quit.

It takes your input, converts it to lowercase for consistency, and checks if it's a valid choice (rock, paper, or scissors).

The computer's choice is generated randomly.

The determineWinner function decides who wins the round based on the game's rules and displays the result.

You can quit the game at any time by typing "quit."

Customization
You can customize the game by modifying the choices array to include additional options or by changing the winning conditions in the determineWinner function. This allows you to create your own variations of the game.

Have fun playing Rock Paper Scissors!
